                <h4>How to Read This Guide</h4>
                <p>
                    In this guide, we will examine the building blocks of React apps: elements and components. Once you master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.This is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React concepts. You can find a list of all its chapters in the navigation sidebar. If you’re reading this from a mobile device, you can access the navigation by pressing the button in the bottom right corner of your screen. Every chapter in this guide builds on the knowledge introduced in earlier chapters. You can learn most of React by reading the “Main Concepts” guide chapters in the order they appear in the sidebar. For example, “Introducing JSX” is the next chapter after this one.

                <p>
                    The following is the most basic code in React.js:
                </p>
                <code>
                    ReactDOM.render(
                        &lth1&gtHello, world!&lt/h1&gt,
                    document.getElementById('root')
                    );

                </code>
                <p>Some other frameworks of Javascript:</p>

                    <li>
                        Vue.js
                    </li>
                    <li>

                <h4>Knowledge Assumptions</h4>
                 <p>
                     React is a JavaScript library, and so we’ll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language. If you don’t feel very confident, we recommend going through a JavaScript tutorial to check your knowledge level and enable you to follow along this guide without getting lost. It might take you between 30 minutes and an hour, but as a result you won’t have to feel like you’re learning both React and JavaScript at the same time.

                    <a>Introducing JSX</a>

                <p>
                    Consider this variable declaration:
                </p><br>

                <code>
                    const element = &lth1&gtHello, world!&lt/h1&lt ;
                </code><br>                

                <p>
                    This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML. It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript. JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the next section. Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Why JSX?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display. Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise. React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

            <article>
                <p>
                    In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:
                </p><br>

                <code>
                    const name = 'Josh Perez';
                    const element = &lth1&gtHello, {name}&lt/h1&gt ;
                    ReactDOM.render(
                        element,
                        document.getElementById('root')
                        );
                </code><br>

                <p>
                    We split JSX over multiple lines for readability. While it isn’t required, when doing this, we also recommend wrapping it in parentheses to avoid the pitfalls of automatic semicolon insertion.
                </p>

            </header>

            <article>

                <p>fter compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects. This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:

                </p><br>

                <code>
                    function getGreeting(user) {
                        if (user) {
                          return &lth1&gtHello, {formatName(user)}!&lt/h1&gt ;
                        }
                        return &lth1&gtHello, Stranger.&lt/h1&gt ;
                      }

                </code><br>

                <p>
                    By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that’s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks.

                    An element describes what you want to see on the screen:
                </p><br>

                <code>
                    const element = &lth1&gtHello, world&lt/h1&gt ;
                </code>

                <p>
                    Even though we create an element describing the whole UI tree on every tick, only the text node whose contents have changed gets updated by React DOM. In our experience, thinking about how the UI should look at any given moment, rather than how to change it over time, eliminates a whole class of bugs.
