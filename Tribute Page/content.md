     In 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium with the aim of turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also considered. Chelsea were founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook), opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.

     Chelsea won promotion to the First Division in their second season, and yo-yoed between the First and Second Divisions in their early years. They reached the 1915 FA Cup Final, where they lost to Sheffield United at Old Trafford, and finished third in the First Division in 1920, the club's best league campaign to that point.Chelsea had a reputation for signing star players and attracted large crowds. The club had the highest average attendance in English football in ten separate seasonsincluding 1907–08, 1909–10, 1911–12,1912–13, 1913–14 and 1919–20. They were FA Cup semi-finalists in 1920 and 1932 and remained in the First Division throughout the 1930s, but success eluded the club in the inter-war years.

 <p>
     Former Arsenal and England centre-forward Ted Drake was appointed manager in 1952 and proceeded to modernise the club. He removed the club's Chelsea pensioner crest, improved the youth set-up and training regime, rebuilt the side with shrewd signings from the lower divisions and amateur leagues, and led Chelsea to their first major trophy success – the League championship – in 1954–55. The following season saw UEFA create the European Champions' Cup, but after objections from The Football League and the FA, Chelsea were persuaded to withdraw from the competition before it started. Chelsea failed to build on this success, and spent the remainder of the 1950s in mid-table. Drake was dismissed in 1961 and replaced by player-coach Tommy Docherty.
 </p>
 <p>
     Docherty built a new team around the group of talented young players emerging from the club's youth set-up, and Chelsea challenged for honours throughout the 1960s, enduring several near-misses. They were on course for a treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup going into the final stages of the 1964–65 season, winning the League Cup but faltering late on in the other two. In three seasons the side were beaten in three major semi-finals and were FA Cup runners-up. Under Docherty's successor, Dave Sexton, Chelsea won the FA Cup in 1970, beating Leeds United 2–1 in a final replay. The following year, Chelsea took their first European honour, a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup triumph, with another replayed win, this time over Real Madrid in Athens.      
 </p>
 <p>
     The late 1970s through to the '80s was a turbulent period for Chelsea. An ambitious redevelopment of Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club,[27] star players were sold and the team were relegated. Further problems were caused by a notorious hooligan element among the support, which was to plague the club throughout the decade.[28] In 1982, Chelsea were, at the nadir of their fortunes, acquired by Ken Bates for the nominal sum of £1, although by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers, meaning the club faced losing their home.[29] On the pitch, the team had fared little better, coming close to relegation to the Third Division for the first time, but in 1983 manager John Neal put together an impressive new team for minimal outlay. Chelsea won the Second Division title in 1983–84 and established themselves in the top division with two top-six finishes, before being relegated again in 1988. The club bounced back immediately by winning the Second Division championship in 1988–89.          
 </p>
 <p>
     After a long-running legal battle, Bates reunited the stadium freehold with the club in 1992 by doing a deal with the banks of the property developers, who had been bankrupted by a market crash.[30] Chelsea's form in the new Premier League was unconvincing, although they did reach the 1994 FA Cup Final. The appointment of Ruud Gullit as player-manager in 1996 began an upturn in the team's fortunes. He added several top international players to the side and led the club to their first major honour since 1971, the FA Cup. Gullit was replaced by Gianluca Vialli, whose reign saw Chelsea win the League Cup, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup in 1998, and the FA Cup in 2000. They also mounted a strong title challenge in 1998–99, finishing four points behind champions Manchester United, and made their first appearance in the UEFA Champions League. Vialli was sacked in favour of Claudio Ranieri, who guided Chelsea to the 2002 FA Cup Final and Champions League qualification in 2002–03.          
 </p>
  <p>
     In July 2003, Bates sold Chelsea to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich for £140 million.[11] Over £100 million was spent on new players, but Ranieri was unable to deliver any trophies, and was replaced by José Mourinho.[32] Under Mourinho, Chelsea became the fifth English team to win back-to-back league championships since the Second World War (2004–05 and 2005–06), in addition to winning an FA Cup (2007) and two League Cups (2005 and 2007). After a poor start to the 2007–2008 season, Mourinho was replaced by Avram Grant, who led the club to their first UEFA Champions League final, which they lost on penalties to Manchester United.          
  </p>
  <p>
     In 2009, under caretaker manager Guus Hiddink, Chelsea won another FA Cup. In 2009–10, his successor Carlo Ancelotti led them to their first Premier League and FA Cup Double, also becoming the first English top-flight club to score 100 league goals in a season since 1963. In 2012, Roberto Di Matteo led Chelsea to their seventh FA Cup, and their first UEFA Champions League title, beating Bayern Munich 4–3 on penalties, the first London club to win the trophy. The following year the club won the UEFA Europa League, making them the first club to hold two major European titles simultaneously and one of five clubs to have won the three main UEFA trophies. Mourinho returned as manager in 2013 and led Chelsea to League Cup success in March 2015, and the Premier League title two months later. Mourinho was sacked after four months of the following season after a poor start.
          
  </p>
  <p>
     In 2017, under new coach Antonio Conte, Chelsea won their sixth English title and the following season won their eighth FA Cup. In 2018 Conte was sacked after a 5th-place finish and replaced with Maurizio Sarri, under whom Chelsea reached the League Cup final, which they lost on penalties to Manchester City[47] and won the Europa League for a second time, beating Arsenal 4–1 in the final. Sarri then left the club to become manager of Juventus and was then replaced by former Chelsea player Frank Lampard. In Lampard's first season he guided Chelsea to 4th place in the Premier League and reached the FA Cup final, losing 2–1 to Arsenal. Lampard was dismissed in January 2021 and replaced with Thomas Tuchel. Under Tuchel, Chelsea reached the FA Cup final, losing 1–0 to Leicester City, and won their second UEFA Champions League title with a 1–0 win over Manchester City in Porto.[52] The club subsequently won the 2021 UEFA Super Cup for the second time by defeating Villarreal 6–5 in a penalty shootout, after it had ended 1–1 in Belfast after extra time.

     On 18 April 2021, Chelsea announced they would be joining a new European Super League, a league competition comprising the biggest European clubs.After a backlash from supporters, the club announced their withdrawal days later.Former Chelsea player Tony Cascarino revealed that the club had been calling ex-players to check up on their health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The club opted against furloughing their non-matchday staff with the decision reportedly coming from Abramovich himself. Chelsea, one of the first clubs to help the NHS, lent the club-owned Millenium Hotel for the NHS staff.

<p>
     The community of hope that grew across the country over the past 18 months found expression of a specific kind for the Chelsea family in Porto. Just as our lives were being released from lockdown, a 21-year-old German made history to the unbridled joy of Blues everywhere.             
  </p>
  <p>
     Kai Havertz’s elegant goal was one of those moments that make us, clinching the club’s second European Cup and sixth UEFA trophy. In the elite club of five who have won every major UEFA trophy, the Blues are now the only one to have bagged two of each. Meanwhile, none of our London neighbours has one Champions League.          
  </p>
  <p>
     The football world’s biggest club final had a TV and digital audience of almost nine million in the UK, and in the USA the viewing figure was 39 per cent bigger than the most recent all-English affair between Liverpool and Tottenham in 2019.    As well as revenue estimated at £100m, the win brings prize entry into the Super Cup against Villarreal in August, when a win would put Chelsea level on European trophies with Manchester United, and the FIFA Club World Cup, slated for Japan in December.               
  </p>
  <p>
     It is also the first honour earned in a year ending in ‘1’ since the Cup Winners’ Cup half a century ago – when we beat Manchester City in the semi-finals twice by the same 1-0 scoreline.
     The three former Academy players who played in Porto formed the largest such cohort for the Blues in a European final since that 1971 victory over this year’s vanquished semi-finalists, Real Madrid.          
  </p>
  <p>
     For the first time in our 116-year history the Blues reached a major final for the fifth season in succession and, as in 2019, 2012, 2008, 2007 and 1998, there were two to contest. Sadly, our 10th FA Cup final of the century was destined to go the way of first-time winners Leicester.   Three days later a revenge win against the Foxes helped secure fourth place in the league for the second season running, and only the fourth time in the club’s top-flight history. In fact, Chelsea have finished in a higher position only 16 times previously.

               
  </p>

  <p>
     On 25 January, that did not look likely. The Blues had slipped down to ninth, and club legend Frank Lampard made way for former PSG man Thomas Tuchel.
     The experienced Bavarian coach’s impact was immediate and enduring. Switching tactics to a back three that bolstered defence and wing-backs who supported the attack, and with less regular players brought back in, the team embarked on a remarkable run. Tuchel was undefeated in his first 14 games in all competitions – a record for any Chelsea boss. That is a wonderful habit, but something else was stirring too.          
  </p>
  <p>
     The East Stand celebrations by sidelined team-mates as Chelsea beat Liga leaders Atletico 2-0 in March revealed the team spirit that would help sweep the Blues all the way to two finals, echoing another season with a mid-season change of coach: 2012.By the final thrilling whistle in Porto Tuchel had masterminded victories over some of the world’s greatest coaches: Pep Guardiola (three times), Diego Simeone (twice), Zinedine Zidane, Jurgen Klopp, Jose Mourinho, and Carlo Ancelotti. By beating Atletico, Real Madrid, and City, no one could say the triumph in Estadio do Dragao was undeserved.

             
  </p>
  <p>
     The winning goal reflected the twin pillars of Roman Abramovich’s plan for the club: a sumptuous pass from Academy graduate Mason Mount and a cultured finish from Kai Havertz, one of our most expensive signings. In the Premier League, only champions Manchester City outperformed Chelsea once Tuchel had arrived, and the Blues have now equalled Arsenal for league victories over the Premier League era. Only Manchester United have managed more.           
  </p>
  <p>
     As a result of the Covid lockdown, the Premier League season began for Chelsea on Monday 14 September – our first opening day in that month for 106 years, and the latest ever in our history.

     The first 10 seasons leading up to World War One all started in September, the latest being 7 September 1907. All seasons since then have begun in August.

     On 13 April 2021, Chelsea also made history by playing a ‘home’ game away from Stamford Bridge for the first time. Covid travel restrictions meant both legs of the Champions League quarter-final clash with Porto were staged at Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan in Seville.           
  </p>
  <p>
     Ironically, for the same reason the final of the competition was later moved to Porto’s home ground, producing our second win in that stadium in five attempts. 

     The past two campaigns have been affected by the pandemic, with a significant number of matches played behind closed doors.

     Crowd-free stadiums were used to explain the apparent loss of home advantage across the Premier League, with away wins (40 per cent) outstripping those for the host (38 per cent).

     For the first time since 2015/16 (when we finished 10th) the Blues earned a marginal majority of our top-flight points on the road. In 2019/20, 55 per cent of our total came at the Bridge and 45 per cent on opposition grounds.           
  </p>
  <p>
     Despite the intensity of the shortened schedule, the number of times they were called into action, and the prevalence of coronavirus, Chelsea’s players missed fewer matches through injury or illness than any other Premier League club.

     According to the specialist website @PremierInjuries, the Blues had 26 injuries or illnesses in 2020/21, at a rate of one absence every 201 minutes played. A cumulative total of 54 games were missed, which was 32 better than the next fewest, Arsenal, on 86.

     Victory over Manchester City in Porto brought the 27th major honour to the club’s trophy cabinet and the 22nd in the past 24 years. All the silverware is on show in a new display at the official museum, which recently reopened along with stadium tours.

     Chelsea also finished the season as London’s highest-placed club for the 14th time in 16 seasons and the 24th occasion since 1907/08.          
  </p>
  <p>
     This was the second Premier league season involving the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system. Although it may not have felt like it, Chelsea fared far better on VAR overturns in 2020/21 than during the previous campaign.

     Of the 13 Stockley Park interventions this season where a review led to a change of decision, the net result was plus three goals for the Blues, compared to minus two last season.          
  </p>
  <p>
     Chelsea Women were in near-unstoppable form again this season, dominating the WSL for back-to-back titles and winning 18 of their 22 matches.

     The attacking duo of Sam Kerr and Fran Kirby was especially delightful to watch, the Aussie winning the Golden Boot and the latter being crowned the Player of the Season. Manager of the Season Emma Hayes, who also steered her stellar crew to Conti Cup glory and a maiden Champions League final, may yet complete a famous treble when the postponed FA Cup quarter-finals resume in September.
